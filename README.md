# Leetcode Solutions
Daily Leetcode Solutions in multiple languages, by multiple people.

## Goals
There are three main goals of this repo and its tools:
1. To hold people accountable to completing a daily Leetcode question
2. To keep people up to date with the basics of algorithms and data strutures go off into the real world of software development
3. To have fun >:]

May be expanded to tackling other coding/hacking problems like the Advent of Code if/when that's desired.

## Submission
### Content Format
There's no particular coding format to be followed, but as this is practice for real life development, try to use the best practice within your chosen language.

### Submission Format
To submit a solution, it must have passed the daily question, and as a verification, please add the runtime and memory usage in 2 comments at the top as follows:
```python
# Runtime: ##ms
# Memory: ##MB
... your code here ...
```

Once ready to submit, please put it in the appropriate location folders, with the file being named with your initals and revision number.

It's assumed that your first attempt and success at the problem in a language is revision 00, and any subsequent revisions would be numbered 01, 02, 03... etc.

You're allowed to make changes to your final solution before you submit it (in case you forgot to remove "print" statements, or think you can improve it). 

For example, Jon Doe submitting a Python solution to the medium Question 0 - "example" would put his file in 

`\medium\0000-example\python\jd-rev-00.py`

### TL;DR
Put your file in
```\[difficulty]\[###-question-name]\[lang]\[initials]-rev-[##].[lang extension]```
with 2 comments with runtime and memory usage if you want.

Don't be needlessly uncooperative, please.

## Miscellaneous
- The owner of the repo can delete/modify any file they wish, at any point in time ~~though I probably won't unless you give me a reason to~~.
- By submitting to this repo you agree that you're a pretty awesome person
- There may be a bot made in the future that scrapes the repo's files to post to a webpage hosted at [the owner's website](https://www.ontothenorth.com)
  - If you want to help with that please let me know
- We won't be checking if the solution actually passes, or if the statistics you provide are truthful but you're only hurting yourself if you lie about it working, so just don't.
