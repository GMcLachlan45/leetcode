# Leetcode Solutions
Daily Leetcode Solutions in multiple languages

## Goals
The goal of this repo is to hold people accountable to completing the daily Leetcode question (which from now on *will* be daily)

May be expanded to tackling other coding/hacking problems like the Advent of Code if/when that's desired.

## Submission
To submit a solution, it must have passed the daily question, and as a verification, please add the runtime and memory usage in 2 comments at the top.

Once ready to submit, please put it in the appropriate location folders, with the file being named with your initals and revision number.

It's assumed that your first blind attempt and success at the problem in a language is revision 01, and any subsequent revisions would be numbered 02, 03... etc. 

For example, Jon Doe submitting a Python solution to the medium Question 0 - "example" would put his file in `\medium\0000-example\python\jd-rev-01.py`

### TL;DR
Put your file in
```\[difficulty]\[###-question-name]\[lang]\[initials]-rev-[##].[lang extension]```
with 2 comments with runtime and memory usage.


We won't be checking if the solution actually passes, but you're only hurting yourself if you lie about it working, so just don't.
